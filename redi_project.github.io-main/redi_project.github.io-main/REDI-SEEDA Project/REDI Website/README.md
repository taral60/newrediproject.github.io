# SEEDA website named REDI

Please refer to the wireframe file located in the seeda redi folder given by Max if you have any concerns based on layout or design.




### Notes for continuing interns/employees from the pervious intern who was in charge of the UI of the site


Most if not all static pages are completed and are fully responsive.


Certain pages will not be responsive due to either time contraints or skill level required for them to work properly on mobile or on a tablet.


Styling on the user based and individual project page sections will requrire to be styled as per the wireframe or to the new interns/employees desires.


Some pages may be left either unfinished or not started and interns/employees brought into the project should refer to the wireframe for the looks and notes on these pages.


Many pages have been created to be used at templates which will have to be worked with in order to make them function with the database, and until the appropriate work is done these pages will remain static
and simply used a a wireframe alternative so that the design work is out of the way.


Images on the site such as the log in, register, and the home pages all use royalty free stock images and will have to be replaced by either company mandated images given by SEEDA (or Max), with the individual project page the image shown with the buildings is just a placeholder. Any text that says user image will be changed the profile picture that a user or company will add when they edit their profile.


Any pages such as the user or company profile pages will not include any kind of editing functionality as it is out of the scope for the current intern's skills as well as several other pages and their own unique technical 
needs as mentioned above or in the notes on these pages respective html, css, or javascript pages.


Everything should have comments on it to help get rid of any confusion that can arise, certain areas or specific lines of code have no comments because they're pretty straight forward to read and understand



#### Note from the previous intern who was in charge of and worked on this site

I do apologize if anything created harships for you or Max, because up until September of 2020 I have only had around 6 - 7 months of experience with web development and quite a few things I was either just learnging for the first time or have yet to perfect. As such my wireframe should provide all the notes and designs that will be needed to finish the site as per Max's scope of work that he tasked me with and it should be very helpful when navigating this site. I wish you luck in the coming time it takes to work on this project. I also apologize if I missed any areas that needed notes.
